Research shows that letting your mind wander fosters creativity. \n\n It’s also found that meditation helps you spot and solve problems in creative ways. It promotes divergent thinking that gets novel ideas flowing. According to these studies, meditation also makes you more open to considering new solutions. Time to breathe."

Whether your idea is an action or a physical creation, bringing it to life will likely involve the hard work of iteration, testing, and refinement. \n\n Just be wary of perfectionism. Push yourself to share your creations with others. By maintaining an open stance, you’ll be able to learn from their feedback. Consider their responses new material that you can draw from the next time you’re embarking on a creative endeavor."
